-Calculates the ko coefficients and prints them to a file. 
-Calculates the k_ij coefficients (reabsorption coefficients) and prints them to the same file
RadTrap_No2.py
-Calculates the radiation trapping coefficients R_ij and prints them to a file
Te_code.py
-Performs the model LR calculations, compares them with experimental LR's, calculates Chi^2 and prints to file
